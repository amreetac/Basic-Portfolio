    <p> Hi. My name is Amreeta Choudhury. I have a 
    Masters degree of Statistics and Biostatistics
    from Rutgers University. Over the past few
    years, I have had an interesting history
    as a Recruiter, Adjunct Professor of NJIT, a Data Science Consultant and this past year, I worked in Wall Street as a Statistical analyst for Full Beauty Brands, a corporation owning online and retail stores Lane Bryant, King Size, Brylane Home, Swimsuits for all.  Throughout my career, the one thing that always stood out to me was the website and programming component of my jobs. I would train many consultants in becoming skilled in the up and coming web languguages and I thought, why not me?

    <br>



    </br>
            I love designing websites. In my current
        role, I am instrumental in overseeing 
        good landing pages for Sollers Institute's
        Data Science programs. As a kid, I would
        play around code in Myspace and GUI programs such as Unbounce, a nice platform
        for making websites. Now I get to follow my
        dream and create them myself!

    <br>
    </br>
            For fun, I love traveling! My goal
        is to become the best developer I can be
        but also to visit each continent at 
        least once as well! My favorite
    vacations have been in Alaska and Greece. 
    Pictures to come soon! Meanwhile, check out my profile on <a href = "http://www.github.com/amreetac/">Github </a> or feel free to send me an email anytime!
